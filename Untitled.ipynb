The dataset contains 1 million ratings collected from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies and it is spread across three tables: ratings, user inforamtion and movie information.</p>\n",

    "## 2. Merging the tables\n",
    "<p>Working with 3 different tables is not very convenient so we are going to merge them into one. That way we will be able to have a broader perspective. Since all of the 3 tables contain the <code>movie_id</code> we don't have to be explicit about on which column to join.</p>\n",
    "<p>One note of importance is the fact that merging big dataframes can be a really costly operation, in terms of resources like memory, so in the world of Big Data such kind of operation is usually performed with the use of cloud computing. Even in our project here a low specifications computer will have a hard time to perform the merge (especially the last one which produces a dataframe of <em>1M x 10</em> dimensions so a work around is to merge in chunks to allow better merory management.</p>"
