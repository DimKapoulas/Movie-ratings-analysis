This dataset is provided by <a src=\"https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/\">GroupLens Research</a> and is collected by users of MovieLens which essentialy is a movie recomendations service (more about MovieLens <a src=\"https://movielens.org/\">here</a>).</p>\n",

    "<p>Just to give a brief description of them, the data provide movie ratings, movie metadata (genres and year), and demographic data about the users(age, zip code, gender identification and occupation) and this is the information that is often of interest in the development of recommendation systems. The dataset contains 1 million ratings collected from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies and it is spread across three tables: ratings, user inforamtion and movie information.</p>\n",
